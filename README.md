Morpho Quick Tips
=================

This repository contains a quick guide to get started with [Morpho](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools/morpho). 

Morpho is a software developed by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) that allows researchers to create metadata, (i.e. describe their data in a standardized format), and create a catalog of data & metadata upon which to query, edit and view data collections. In addition, it also provides the means to access network servers - like the KNB - in order to query, view and retrieve all relevant, public ecological data!

For a more comprehensive user guide, please refer to the official Morpho user guide: <https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/dist/MorphoUserGuide.pdf>
